This project records some solutions to Machine learning problem in course *Introduction to Machine learning* by Prof.Zhi-Hua Zhou(周志华) in Nanjing University, spring 2017.
Copyright: All problems are our homework and can be put in public with the approval of Prof.Zhi-Hua Zhou(周志华), the solutions are written by myself. Most of the solutions are correct (my grades of those homeworks are close to full marks), but the solutions offered by Assistant can't be included in this project.
